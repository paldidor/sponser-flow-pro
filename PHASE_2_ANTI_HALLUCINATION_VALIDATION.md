# Phase 2: Anti-Hallucination Implementation Validation Guide

## üéØ Overview
This phase prevents the AI from inventing fake team names, prices, or sponsorship details when database searches return 0 results.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

### Backend Changes (ai-advisor/index.ts)

- [x] **Strengthened System Prompt (Lines 62-89)**
  - Added "CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES" section
  - Explicit rule: "NEVER EVER invent, fabricate, or make up team names"
  - Clear instruction: "If no recommendations are in your system context, they DO NOT EXIST"
  - Provided exact template for 0 results response
  - Examples of WRONG vs CORRECT responses

- [x] **Enhanced 0-Results Handling (Lines 508-544)**
  - Added "CRITICAL SYSTEM ALERT - 0 RESULTS FOUND" message
  - Provides REQUIRED RESPONSE template
  - Lists explicit "DO NOT" rules (don't invent teams, prices, etc.)
  - Reinforces: "ONLY teams explicitly listed in your context exist"

### Test Coverage

- [x] **Created Phase 2 Tests** (useAIAdvisor.phase2.test.ts)
  - System prompt anti-hallucination rules validation
  - Zero results detection and handling
  - Hallucination pattern detection
  - Missing geocoding edge cases
  - Integration with Phase 1 changes

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Automated Tests

```bash
npm test src/hooks/__tests__/useAIAdvisor.phase2.test.ts
```

All tests should pass, validating:
- Anti-hallucination rules are in place
- 0-results messages are explicit
- Patterns that indicate hallucination are blocked

### Manual Testing

#### Test 1: Zero Results Due to Tight Budget ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Setup:**
1. Navigate to Business Dashboard
2. Ensure your business profile has valid location (city, state with lat/lon)
3. Open AI Advisor chat

**Steps:**
1. Type: "Show me sponsorships under $10"
2. Wait for AI response

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ AI says: "I couldn't find any teams matching those criteria right now. Want to try a different location, budget, or sport?"
- ‚úÖ NO team names are mentioned
- ‚úÖ NO prices are mentioned
- ‚úÖ NO fake suggestions like "Try XYZ Team for $X"

**Failure Signs:**
- ‚ùå AI mentions specific team names (e.g., "Try Newark Soccer Club")
- ‚ùå AI suggests specific prices (e.g., "for $3,000")
- ‚ùå AI says "I found" when there are 0 results

---

#### Test 2: Zero Results Due to Rare Sport ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Setup:**
1. Business profile with valid location
2. Open AI Advisor chat

**Steps:**
1. Type: "Find cricket sponsorships"
2. Wait for response

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ AI admits: "I couldn't find any teams matching those criteria"
- ‚úÖ Suggests trying different sport: "Want to try a different sport?"
- ‚úÖ NO invented cricket team names

**Failure Signs:**
- ‚ùå AI mentions cricket teams by name
- ‚ùå AI fabricates cricket sponsorship details

---

#### Test 3: Missing Geocoding Edge Case

**Setup:**
1. Check database for business profiles without location_lat/lon:
```sql
SELECT id, business_name, location_lat, location_lon 
FROM business_profiles 
WHERE location_lat IS NULL 
LIMIT 1;
```
2. Log in as that business user

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Advisor
2. Type: "Show me soccer sponsorships"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ AI asks: "What's your business location or zip code?" (or similar)
- ‚úÖ Does NOT claim to find results
- ‚úÖ Does NOT invent team names

**Failure Signs:**
- ‚ùå AI claims to find teams without location data
- ‚ùå AI suggests specific teams without geocoding

---

#### Test 4: Valid Results Still Work (Regression Test)

**Setup:**
1. Business profile with valid location (e.g., San Francisco)
2. Open AI Advisor

**Steps:**
1. Type: "Show me soccer sponsorships under $5,000"
2. Wait for response

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ AI shows real teams from database
- ‚úÖ Recommendation cards appear with team names, prices, images
- ‚úÖ Team names match actual teams in database
- ‚úÖ Prices match package prices in database
- ‚úÖ Marketplace URLs work when clicked

**Verification:**
- Check database to confirm teams exist:
```sql
SELECT tp.team_name, sp.name, sp.price
FROM team_profiles tp
JOIN sponsorship_offers so ON so.team_profile_id = tp.id
JOIN sponsorship_packages sp ON sp.sponsorship_offer_id = so.id
WHERE tp.sport = 'Soccer'
AND sp.price <= 5000
LIMIT 3;
```

---

#### Test 5: Conversation Persistence After 0 Results

**Setup:**
1. Start fresh conversation with AI Advisor

**Steps:**
1. Type: "Find sponsorships under $5" (unrealistic budget)
2. Wait for 0-results response
3. Refresh page
4. Continue same conversation
5. Type: "How about under $10?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ AI remembers previous conversation
- ‚úÖ Still returns 0 results message (or adjusts if budget is now realistic)
- ‚úÖ Never invents teams across conversation refreshes

---

## üîç Edge Function Logs Verification

After testing, check Supabase edge function logs:

```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gtlxdbokhtdtfmziacai/functions/ai-advisor/logs
```

**Look for:**
- ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Found 0 recommendations" when no results
- ‚úÖ "CRITICAL SYSTEM ALERT - 0 RESULTS FOUND" in AI messages
- ‚úÖ No errors or exceptions
- ‚ùå Any hallucinated team names in AI responses (failure indicator)

**Example Good Log:**
```
üîç Searching for recommendations with interaction filtering...
‚úÖ Found 0 recommendations, showing 0 after filtering
üìä Conversation Stats: {
  messageCount: 1,
  hasRecommendations: false,
  recommendationCount: 0,
  ...
}
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: AI Still Inventing Teams
**Symptom:** AI mentions team names when 0 results found

**Solution:**
- Verify system prompt includes anti-hallucination rules (lines 62-89)
- Check 0-results message is being sent (lines 539-557)
- Review edge function logs for exact AI context

### Issue 2: No Search Triggered
**Symptom:** AI doesn't search even with valid criteria

**Solution:**
- Check `shouldSearch` logic (line 468)
- Verify geocoding exists: `SELECT location_lat, location_lon FROM business_profiles`
- Review conversation flow logs

### Issue 3: Cards Not Appearing (Phase 1 Regression)
**Symptom:** Valid results don't show cards

**Solution:**
- Verify `recommendation_data` field has data
- Check frontend `useAIAdvisor.ts` loads from `rec.recommendation_data`
- See Phase 1 validation guide

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Phase 2 is successfully implemented when:

1. **Zero Results Handling:**
   - [ ] AI NEVER invents team names when 0 results
   - [ ] AI uses exact template: "I couldn't find any teams matching those criteria..."
   - [ ] AI suggests adjusting preferences (budget, sport, location)

2. **Valid Results Still Work:**
   - [ ] Real teams appear when database has matches
   - [ ] Recommendation cards display correctly (Phase 1)
   - [ ] All team details match database

3. **Edge Cases Covered:**
   - [ ] Missing geocoding handled gracefully
   - [ ] Unrealistic budgets return 0 results correctly
   - [ ] Rare sports (cricket, rugby) handled without hallucination

4. **Logs Confirm:**
   - [ ] "0 RESULTS FOUND" messages in logs when appropriate
   - [ ] No fabricated team names in AI responses
   - [ ] Conversation stats accurate

## üìä Database Queries for Validation

### Check for teams matching criteria:
```sql
-- Should return 0 for unrealistic budgets
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM sponsorship_packages 
WHERE price <= 10;
```

### Verify geocoding coverage:
```sql
-- Check which profiles lack geocoding
SELECT 
  id, 
  business_name, 
  city, 
  state,
  location_lat IS NOT NULL as has_lat,
  location_lon IS NOT NULL as has_lon
FROM business_profiles;
```

### Review recent AI recommendations:
```sql
-- Check if any hallucinated teams were stored
SELECT 
  ar.created_at,
  ar.recommendation_data->>'team_name' as team_name,
  ar.recommendation_data->>'price' as price,
  ar.conversation_id
FROM ai_recommendations ar
ORDER BY ar.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üöÄ Next Steps After Validation

Once Phase 2 passes all tests:

1. **Mark Phase 2 Complete** ‚úÖ
2. **Proceed to Phase 3:** Complete Geocoding for All Profiles
   - Fix missing lat/lon for existing business profiles
   - Add fallback in AI Advisor to ask for zip code

3. **Consider Phase 4:** Convert to Full-Screen Modal (UX improvement)
