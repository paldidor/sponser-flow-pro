 * PHASE 2: Prevent AI Hallucination Tests
 * 
 * These tests validate that:
 * 1. The AI never invents fake team names when 0 results are found
 * 2. The system prompt includes explicit anti-hallucination rules
 * 3. The 0-results message is clear and forces the AI to admit no results
 * 4. The AI doesn't fabricate prices, teams, or details

/**
 * MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST (After Implementation)
 * 
 * Test Case 1: Zero Results Due to Tight Budget
 * - Set business location to valid coordinates
 * - Ask for sponsorships with budget $1-$10 (unrealistic)
 * - Expected: AI says "couldn't find any teams matching those criteria"
 * - NOT expected: AI invents fake team names or prices
 * 
 * Test Case 2: Zero Results Due to Missing Sport
 * - Set business location to valid coordinates
 * - Ask for "Cricket" sponsorships (likely no results)
 * - Expected: AI admits no results and suggests alternatives
 * - NOT expected: AI fabricates cricket teams
 * 
 * Test Case 3: Missing Geocoding
 * - Use business profile without location_lat/lon
 * - Ask AI to find sponsorships
 * - Expected: AI asks for location or zip code
 * - NOT expected: AI claims to find results or invents teams
 * 
 * Test Case 4: Valid Results Still Work
 * - Set business location to valid coordinates
 * - Ask for Soccer sponsorships with $100-$5000 budget
 * - Expected: AI shows real teams from database
 * - Verify: Cards display with team names matching database
 * 
 * Test Case 5: Conversation Persistence
 * - Start conversation, get 0 results
 * - Refresh page and continue same conversation
 * - Expected: AI remembers previous response, doesn't hallucinate new teams
