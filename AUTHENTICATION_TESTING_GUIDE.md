  ```
  - [ ] `rowsecurity` should be `true`

- [ ] Protected routes verify authentication on server side
- [ ] No sensitive data logged to console

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Password Reset:** Placeholder only - needs full implementation
2. **Business Dashboard:** Currently redirects to marketplace
3. **Admin Role:** No dedicated admin interface yet
4. **Email Confirmation:** May need to be disabled in Supabase for testing

### Future Features
- [ ] Implement password reset flow
- [ ] Create business user dashboard
- [ ] Add admin panel
- [ ] Add profile settings page
- [ ] Implement "Remember Me" functionality
- [ ] Add 2FA support

## Quick Test Script

To quickly test the complete flow:

1. **Create new account:**
   - Go to `/auth` ‚Üí Sign up ‚Üí Use `test@example.com` / `password123`
   - Should redirect to `/team/onboarding`

2. **Complete onboarding:**
   - Fill in team profile
   - Should redirect to `/team/dashboard`

3. **Test session persistence:**
   - Refresh page ‚Üí Should stay on dashboard
   - Navigate to `/` ‚Üí Should show user dropdown in header

4. **Sign out and back in:**
   - Click Sign Out ‚Üí Should go to `/`
   - Click Sign In ‚Üí Enter credentials ‚Üí Should go to `/team/dashboard`

## Database Queries for Debugging

```sql
-- Check user's role
SELECT ur.role, p.email 
FROM user_roles ur 
JOIN profiles p ON p.user_id = ur.user_id 
WHERE ur.user_id = auth.uid();

-- Check all users and their roles (admin only)
SELECT 
  p.email,
  ur.role,
  CASE WHEN tp.id IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END as has_team_profile
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_roles ur ON ur.user_id = p.user_id
LEFT JOIN team_profiles tp ON tp.user_id = p.user_id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;

-- Manually change a user's role (for testing)
UPDATE user_roles 
SET role = 'business' 
WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
```
