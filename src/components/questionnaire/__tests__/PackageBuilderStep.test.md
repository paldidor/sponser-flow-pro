## Functional Tests

### Database Integration
- [ ] **Fetch placements on load**
  - Query to `placement_options` table executes
  - Ordered by: is_popular DESC, category, name
  - Results populate state correctly
  - Loading state ends after fetch

- [ ] **Handle fetch errors**
  - Network error shows toast notification
  - Error logged to console
  - Loading state ends even on error
  - User can retry (refresh page)

### Search Functionality

  - Popular section filters
  - All category sections filter
  - Empty categories handled gracefully

- [ ] **Search query state**
  - Query stored in state
  - Persists while navigating within package
  - Cleared when clear button clicked
  - Case-insensitive comparison works

### Category Expansion
- [ ] **Toggle state management**
  - Each category has independent open/closed state
  - State persists while editing package
  - Popular auto-expands on initial load
  - Other categories start collapsed

- [ ] **Multiple categories**
  - Can open multiple categories simultaneously
  - No conflicts between category states
  - Smooth animations on expand/collapse

### Placement Selection
- [ ] **Multi-select behavior**
  - Can select multiple placements per package
  - Selection stored as array of IDs
  - Selections independent per package
  - Can select same placement in multiple packages

- [ ] **Toggle logic**
  - Click once â†’ adds to selection
  - Click again â†’ removes from selection
  - No duplicates in placementIds array
  - State updates correctly

### Custom Placement Creation
- [ ] **Validation**
  - Trimmed input required (no spaces-only)
  - Duplicate check (case-insensitive)
  - Shows "Duplicate" toast if exists
  - Button disabled when empty

- [ ] **Database save**
  - INSERT query to `placement_options`
  - Sets category as "custom"
  - Sets is_popular as false
  - Returns created placement data

- [ ] **State update**
  - New placement added to placements array
  - Immediately available for selection
  - Appears in Custom category
  - Input field clears after add
  - Success toast displays

- [ ] **Error handling**
  - Database errors caught
  - Error toast shown to user
  - Placement not added to state on error
  - Input value preserved on error

### Package Management
- [ ] **Add package**
  - New package object created with unique ID
  - Empty name, 0 price, empty placementIds
  - Added to packages array
  - Rendered immediately

- [ ] **Remove package**
  - Only works when >1 package exists
  - Correct package removed by ID
  - Other packages unchanged
  - Validation updates after removal

- [ ] **Update package fields**
  - Name updates correctly
  - Price updates correctly (numeric only)
  - PlacementIds updates via toggle function
  - State updates trigger validation

### Validation Logic
- [ ] **Individual package validation**
  - Name must be non-empty (trimmed)
  - Price must be > 0
  - At least one placement selected
  - All three conditions required

- [ ] **Overall validity**
  - ALL packages must be valid
  - onValidityChange called with correct boolean
  - Continue button disabled when invalid
  - Validation runs on every state change

### Data Flow
- [ ] **Initialize with existing data**
  - initialPackages prop respected
  - Falls back to single empty package if none
  - Existing selections preserved
  - Edit mode works correctly

- [ ] **Value change callback**
  - onValueChange called on every update
  - Passes current packages array
  - Parent component receives updates
  - Data persists in QuestionnaireFlow state

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Empty placements array**
  - Handles gracefully (shouldn't happen in production)
  - No categories render
  - Custom placement still works

- [ ] **No popular placements**
  - Popular section doesn't render
  - Categories work normally
  - No errors or warnings

- [ ] **All placements filtered out**

## Integration Tests

6. Verify Packages 2 & 3 unchanged
7. Remove Package 2
8. Verify Packages 1 & 3 intact

**Expected:** Packages completely independent, no cross-contamination

### Custom Placement Lifecycle

2. Verify appears in Custom category
3. Select it in Package 1
